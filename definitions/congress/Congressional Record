The daily transcript of legislative activity in the House and Senate.

It includes a transcript of debate, bills introduced, committee reports filed, bills and amendments considered on the Floor, committee meetings or hearings held, and expected committee action, as well as some inserted material, called “extension of remarks.” There is a daily edition that is printed overnight and is a record of the prior day’s legislative activity, and the bound edition published at the end of a Congress.
